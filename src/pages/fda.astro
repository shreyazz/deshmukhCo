            FSSAI is an abbreviation used for Food Safety and Standards
            Authority of India. FSSAI license is mandatory before starting any
            food business. This restriction is laid down in Food Safety &
            Standards Act, 2006. This step is taken by government so as to
            ensure that food products undergo certain quality checks, thereby
            reducing the instances of adulteration, substandard products and
            improve accountability of manufacturers.
