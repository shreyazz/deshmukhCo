            MSME stands for micro, small and medium enterprises and any
            enterprise that falls under any of these three categories. MSME
            enterprises are the backbone of any economy and are an engine of
            economic growth, promoting equitable development for all. Therefore,
            to support and promote MSMEs, the Government of India through
            various subsidies, schemes and incentives promote MSMEs through the
            MSMED Act. To avail the benefits under the MSMED Act from Central or
            State Government and the Banking Sector, MSME Registration is
            required.

          <p class="my-4 text-[#272727]">
            over the years, manufacturing has emerged as one of the high growth
            sectors in India. Introduction of schemes like “Make in India” has
            given an adequate boost to the sector to a level that India is
            expected to become the fifth largest manufacturing country in the
            world by the end of the year 2020. The manufacturing sector in India
            has evolved from its earlier stages of industrialization to its
            current phase of global competitiveness, making it a great location
            for newer, smaller businesses to manufacture. To set up a factory in
            India, you need to apply for licenses from the centre and state
            government. Factory Registration in our country is regulated by the
            provisions of the Factories Act 1948. Factories Act regulates the
            working condition in factories and deals with various problems
            concerning the health, safety, efficiency, and well being of the
            persons at workplaces. This blog will provide you with an insight
            into the procedure involved in Factory Registration in India.
